Python configuration for wmii window manager

Optional Dependencies:

	pyalsaaudio


Install:

	mv ~/.wmii-hg ~/.origwmii-hg
	git clone git://github.com/decurtis/wmpy.git ~/.wmii-hg
	cd ~/.wmii-hg
	python setup.py build


Running:

	~/.wmii-hg/wmiirc


Configuration:

	Edit the 'wmiirc' file to make changes to your personal configuration.

	All variables in the /ctl are stored in the 'config' variable in the
	wmii module.  Color configurations are stored in the 'themes.py'
	file and can also be configured manually by accessing the 'colors'
	variable.


Notes:

	One thing this configuration system does differently is ordering of
	tags and adding new tags.  New tags get added in the order they are
	received but tagging is still dynamic, meaning you can define the
	order of all the tags you'll ever want, and they will not show up
	until they have a client in them, but you can still move to them
	like you normally would (Mod4-#) even though they are empty.  In the
	case you want to add a tag in the middle of running, it will find an
	open slot (1-9) and be placed there.
